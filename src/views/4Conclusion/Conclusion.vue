    <h2>You know the value of water when the well is dry</h2>
    <p>Much of the Western US depends on water from forested watersheds, and itâ€™s not just surface runoff that feels the burn.  Large reservoirs store runoff and groundwater, and these reservoirs are vulnerable to fire impacts too. The Buffalo Creek Fire in 1996 and the Hayman Fire in 2002 caused substantial sediment loads into the Strontia Springs reservoir that provides water supply to the city of Denver, Colorado.  Denver Water, who operates the reservoir, incurred $26 million in costs associated with dredging the reservoir to remove sediment and recover storage (Martin, 2016).</p>
    <p>Colorado water providers are hardly alone in struggling with the challenges that wildfire brings. The 2007 Zaca Fire near Santa Barbara, California burned over 240,000 acres. The US Forest Service estimated that post-fire erosion of sediment would cause over 50% loss of reservoir storage in one of the main water supply reservoirs. Runoff from the burn scar of the Zaca Fire was also more expensive to treat to reach drinking water standards. Water treatment costs for the City of Santa Barbara increased by a factor of 60 after the fire, going from $33,000 per year to $2.1 million per year.</p>
    <p>Water supply watersheds in the West will continue to be under fire in the coming decades. Scientists from the USGS Water Mission Area will be working to deliver timely science to understand how severely and for how long wildfire will impact watersheds.</p>
