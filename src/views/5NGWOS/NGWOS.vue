      <h2><span class="lowlight">USGS efforts</span> to improve prediction of wildfire impacts on water availability</h2>
      <p>The USGS Water Resources Mission Area is working to provide an improved understanding of how extreme events, such as wildfire, impact water availability through short-term changes in the quantity and quality of resources accessible for use.  Better measurement and prediction of water availability after wildfire will benefit water suppliers across the United States.</p>
      <p>The USGS <a href="to https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/usgs-next-generation-water-observing-system-ngwos?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects">Next Generation Water Observing System</a> (NGWOS) is generating integrated data on streamflow, groundwater, evapotranspiration, snowpack, soil moisture, water quality, and water use. </p>
      <p>One focus of NGWOS will be the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/next-generation-water-observing-system-upper-colorado-river?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects">Upper Colorado River Basin,</a> an area that provides much of the flow in the Colorado River. The Colorado River supplies water for more than 40 million people and nearly 5.5 million acres of farmland across the western United States and Mexico. Yet the Upper Colorado River Basin is vulnerable to drought, wildfire, changing snowpack, and many other factors that affect water supply. The USGS WMA is working to improve measurement and modeling of wildfire impacts on water availability in the region, which was affected by major wildfires in 2020. </p>
