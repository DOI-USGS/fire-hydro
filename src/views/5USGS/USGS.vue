      <h2><span class="lowlight">USGS efforts</span> to improve prediction of wildfire impacts on water availability</h2>
      <p>The USGS Water Resources Mission Area science strategy is to enhance the way we observe, understand, predict and deliver hydrologic information in an integrated way. The ultimate objective integrated water science is the development of state-of-the-art water-availability models for resource assessment, both in targeted watersheds and Nationally, supported by high-density innovative monitoring and cutting-edge research. One of the focus areas of USGS integrated water science is to improve understanding of how extreme events, such as wildfire, impact water availability in terms of both water quality and quantity.</p>
      <p>Better measurement and prediction of water availability after wildfire benefits water suppliers across the United States. The improved understanding of how wildfire impacts water availability will be accomplished primarily through five WMA programs â€” the <a href="to https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/usgs-next-generation-water-observing-system-ngwos?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects" target="_blank">Next Generation Water Observing System</a> program (NGWOS), the Water Hazards program, the Integrated Water Prediction (IWP) program, the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/integrated-water-availability-assessments-iwaas?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects" target="_blank">Integrated Water Availability Assessments</a> (IWAAs) program, and Water Availability Impacts of Extreme Events (WAIEE) program.</p>
